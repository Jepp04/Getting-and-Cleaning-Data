## Getting-and-Cleaning-Data
This document is used as a reference to guide you through the repository and it's content. There are 4 main files: 

* README.md
* CodeBook.Rmd
* run_analysis.R
* tidy_Data.txt

### README.md
This file is the current file you are reading and acts as a guide around this project.

### CodeBook.Rmd
This document explains all the code and data used within this project in more detail.

### run_analysis.R
This file contains the actual code to be executed to obtain the final tidy data set as requested by the project. The following steps listed below also listed in the instructions of the projects are used to generate the final data set:

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

###  tidy_Data.txt
This file contains the final tidy data set with the average over each variable for each activity and each subject.
